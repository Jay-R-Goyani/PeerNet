System Workflow:

1. Tracker Initialization:
    - There is one tracker in the system.

2. Node 1 Startup:
    - Sends an ACK message to the tracker to check if the tracker is alive.
    - Receives an ACK response from the tracker, confirming it is online.
    - Notifies the tracker that it has the file `sample.pdf` available.

3. Node 2 Startup:
    - Sends an ACK message to the tracker to check if the tracker is alive.
    - Receives an ACK response from the tracker, confirming it is online.
    - Requests the tracker for a list of nodes that have the file `sample.pdf`.
    - The tracker responds with a list of nodes (e.g., Node 1) that currently hold the file.

4. Node 2 Interaction:
    - Sends ping requests to the nodes in the list (e.g., Node 1).
    - Waits for pong responses and calculates the latency for each node.
    - Selects the few nodes(Upto MAX_SPLITTNES_RATE) with the lowest latency to download the file from.

5. File Transfer:
    - Node 2 sends a file request to Node 1.
    - Node 2 receives the file `sample.pdf` from Node 1.

6. Post-Download Update:
    - Once the download is complete, Node 2 notifies the tracker that it now also has the file `sample.pdf`.


Throughout the entire process, nodes periodically send heartbeat messages to the tracker to indicate they are active. 
The tracker receives these messages periodically, and if it detects that a node has stopped sending heartbeats, 
it will remove that node's information from its records.
