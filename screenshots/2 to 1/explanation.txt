System Workflow:

Continuing from 1 to 1:
    - now node 1 and node 3 both have `sample.pdf`

1. Node 3 Startup (Downloader):
    - Sends an ACK message to the tracker to check if the tracker is alive.
    - Receives an ACK response from the tracker.
    - Requests a list of nodes that have the file `sample.pdf`.

2. Tracker Response:
    - The tracker responds with a list of nodes that have the file, i.e., Node 1 and Node 2.

3. Node 3 Interaction:
    - Sends ping requests to Node 1 and Node 2.
    - Waits for pong responses and measures the latency to each sender node.
    - Selects the few nodes(Upto MAX_SPLITTNES_RATE) with the lowest latency for downloading the file.

4. File Transfer:
    - Node 3 sends a file request to the selected node (Node 1 and Node 2).
    - Node 1 and Node 2 will send half size of file.
    - Node 3 will sort both chunks and assemble`sample.pdf` file and store.

5. Post-Download Update:
    - After successfully downloading the file, Node 3 notifies the tracker that it now also has `sample.pdf`.


Throughout the entire process, nodes periodically send heartbeat messages to the tracker to indicate they are active. 
The tracker receives these messages periodically, and if it detects that a node has stopped sending heartbeats, 
it will remove that node's information from its records.
